This should contains all the required files or scripts to build tools for the Lego Nxt brick under Linux or Mac OS X. Feel free to adapt to your tastes:
	* app_template/ : Template files for applications source and oil files. Used by scripts/nxt_create.
	* gcc/ : holds build.sh which can be used to compile a arm-elf gcc and binutils. The compiled files are installed under the install directory.
	* nexttool/ : holds Free Pascal Compiler, nexttool and libusb sources... compile manually.

			make; make install
			popd

		  cd nexttool
			Edit nexttool.mak
				Add PFLAGS += -Fl /path/to/libusb
				Add -Xt aux options du linker.
			Add /path/to/fpc/usr/bin au PATH
			make -f nexttool.make

	* trampoline/ : holds build.sh which can be used to fetch trampoline (from the svn repository) and compile the goil tool. Compiled files are installed under the install directory.
	  WARNING: Does not seem to work on Mac osx 10.6.8, probably a broken dependency to a different version of libpm.
	* scripts/ : holds a few helpfull scripts to create an application source and goil files, process a goil file and send, using nexttool, files to a brick.
